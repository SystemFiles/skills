# Architecture

This repo is a **skills.sh source catalog** and an [Agent Plugin](https://agent-plugins.org) package. Consumers install skills with the [skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) (`bunx skills add SystemFiles/skills …`) or load the whole catalog as a Cursor plugin via root `plugin.json`. Agents load installed `SKILL.md` files; this repo’s Python tooling only validates the catalog and vendors upstream copies. Prefer `bun`/`bunx` over `npm`/`npx`.

## Layout

```text
.
├── plugin.json             # Agent Plugins manifest (Cursor / portable clients)
├── skills/<name>/          # installable units (authored + vendored)
│   └── SKILL.md            # required; YAML frontmatter name + description
├── scripts/                # catalog maintenance (sync / capture)
├── tests/                  # pytest contracts + script unit tests
├── upstream-skills.toml    # declaration of vendored skills
├── upstream-skills.lock.json
├── Taskfile.yml            # single automation entry point
├── docs/                   # agent/dev architecture + local development
└── .github/workflows/      # ci, pr-title-lint, sync-upstream-skills
```

Optional under a skill: `scripts/`, `evals/`, `references/`, `examples/`, attribution files (`LICENSE`, `NOTICE`).

```

| Kind | Source of truth | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Authored** | `skills/<name>/` in this repo | Edit freely; keep dir name = frontmatter `name` |
| **Vendored** | `upstream-skills.toml` + upstream git | Do not hand-edit `skills/<name>/`; change catalog → re-sync → commit tree + lockfile |

Sync clones each `[[skill]]`, copies the skill folder (and LICENSE/NOTICE), refuses copyleft licenses, writes provenance to `upstream-skills.lock.json`. Scheduled workflow [sync-upstream-skills](../.github/workflows/sync-upstream-skills.yml) refreshes vendored copies; pushes use `SYNC_UPSTREAM_PAT` so other workflows still fire.

`task capture-project PROJECT=…` scans another project’s installed skills and proposes catalog entries. Local-only skills with no shareable git source stay out of the catalog (promotion target: authored skills here).

## Discovery contract

The skills CLI finds skills by **frontmatter `name`**, not directory name alone. Contract tests enforce:

- Non-empty `name` and `description`
- Directory name equals frontmatter `name`
- Names unique across `skills/`
- A pinned `EXPECTED_SKILLS` set stays present (authored baseline; update when adding/removing authored skills)

Install surface for humans: root `README.md` skill tables.

## Cursor / Agent Plugin install

Root [`plugin.json`](../plugin.json) follows the [Agent Plugins](https://agent-plugins.org) standard. Cursor discovers every immediate child of `skills/` that has a `SKILL.md`. Catalog dirs (`scripts/`, `tests/`, `docs/`) stay in-repo; plugin clients ignore them.

| Surface | Mechanism | Cloud Agents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| skills CLI | `bunx skills add …` into agent skill dirs | No — cloud VMs lack user home installs |
| Cursor plugin | Team Marketplace import of this repo, or `~/.cursor/plugins/local` symlink | Verify after install; if missing, commit skills under `.agents/skills/` / `.cursor/skills/` in the target repo |

Team distribution: Dashboard → Plugins → import this GitHub repo → **Required** or **Default On**. Local dry-run: symlink the repo to `~/.cursor/plugins/local/systemfiles-skills` and reload Cursor.

## Quality pipeline

```text
local / CI
    task ci
      ├─ task validate  →  uv run pytest -q
      └─ task lint      →  uv run pre-commit run --all-files
                            (markdownlint, cspell, gitleaks, …)

local (opt-in; needs Cursor agent CLI)
    task evals:validate          →  scripts/validate_evals.py
    task evals [SKILL=<name>]    →  agent -p (Sonnet 5): one process per eval in parallel, then aggregate

PR title  →  Conventional Commits (pr-title-lint workflow)
```

No runtime services or Docker: catalog + scripts only. `pyproject.toml` sets `package = false`; uv only manages the dev dependency group.

## Skill-internal patterns (authored)

Prefer **deterministic helpers** under `skills/<name>/scripts/` for anything an agent would otherwise invent (CLIs, schemas, allowlists). Cover them from repo-root `tests/`.

Skills that talk to external systems (GitHub, etc.) should keep **evals offline** via local snapshots (no live I/O). Reserve mocks for script unit tests — e.g. `issue-triage` uses issue fixtures in `evals/` and `mock_gh.py` only under `tests/`.

## Non-canon paths

- `.lavish/` — local review artifacts; not architecture or process canon
- `.issue-triage/` — issue-triage clarifying Q&A / resume logs; gitignored
- `.agents/`, `skills-lock.json` — install-side artifacts; gitignored (this repo is a source, not a consumer)
- `skills/*-workspace/` — skill-creator eval run workspaces; gitignored
