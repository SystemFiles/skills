# Agent Context Generator

Inventory the repo, capture conventions and workflows, then write `AGENTS.md` in the section order below. Prefer `just`/`make`/`task` entry points. Include wrap-up duties: update the README after significant changes, and summarize work in conventional commits.

---

## Phase 1 · Understand the Repository

The codebase is the source of truth. Treat README, CONTRIBUTING, and other docs as hints that may be stale. Validate claims against source, configs, scripts, CI, and manifests. When docs contradict the code, the code wins — flag the discrepancy.

1. **Run the bundled inventory script first**
   - Run [`scripts/repo-inventory`](scripts/repo-inventory) from the repo root. It performs the deterministic data-gathering so you don't run a dozen probes by hand: a `.git`/`.jj`-pruned, gitignore-aware `tree` (with `tree --prune` and `git ls-files` fallbacks), detected `languages`/`package_managers`, automation `runners` plus `make_targets`/`just_recipes`, `ci_files`, and `env_files`.
   - Read its `key=value` lines as the **factual baseline** for the steps below. Use `-C <dir>` to scope a subdirectory or `--depth <n>` to widen/trim the tree.
   - This is fact-gathering only; everything below adds the judgment the script cannot infer (ownership, intent, stale-doc reconciliation).
2. **Check for existing AGENTS.md**
   - Use `glob` or the inventory tree to discover current files. Determine scope inheritance so you can update or extend instead of duplicating.
3. **Skim docs as hints**
   - Skim `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and other onboarding docs for setup and workflow clues.
   - Cross-reference every stated convention, command, or workflow against the codebase (and the inventory) before including it in AGENTS.md.
   - If `docs/` or `documentation/` exists, scan for references but verify each against the code.
4. **Survey Project Layout**
   - Start from the inventory `[tree]` and `languages`. Add primary build targets and ownership the script can't infer (e.g., "`src/ui` maintained by Frontend team").
   - Check for `plans/`, `docs/`, or other knowledge directories. Flag must-read files (ADR indexes, architecture overviews, runbooks) to reference later in AGENTS.md.
   - If `tree` is unavailable, the script falls back automatically; trim the captured tree to the top 2–3 levels and note omissions for brevity.
5. **Confirm Automation Runners**
   - The inventory reports `runners`, `make_targets`, and (when `just` is installed) `just_recipes`. Confirm which commands are canonical for linting, testing, building, and syncing data; note the definitive task names for inclusion later.
   - If `just` is not installed, inspect the `Justfile` directly for recipe names.
6. **Catalog Tooling & Environment**
   - The inventory gives `languages`, `package_managers`, and `env_files`. Add required runtimes, secrets handling, and local services it can't detect.
   - Review any `.env.example`, `config/`, or secrets documentation surfaced in `env_files` that agents must read.
7. **Clarify Testing & Quality Gates**
   - Start from the inventory `ci_files`, then identify test suites, coverage expectations, linting, and formatting.
8. **Resolve Ambiguities Early**
   - Whenever conventions, ownership, or workflows seem unclear, prompt the developer with focused questions before drafting the guide.
   - Ask explicitly whether existing `plans/` or documentation directories are authoritative or stale, and clarify what canon to reference.

> **Outcome:** A structured notes list describing layout, tooling, commands, testing, release process, documentation references, pending questions, and update expectations.

## Phase 2 · Plan the AGENTS.md Structure
Follow this opinionated order to keep files consistent and scannable:

1. **Header** — Title + short purpose statement.
2. **Context Marker** — Emoji marker (🧠) so agents signal they have loaded project context.
3. **Quick Facts** — Table or bullet summary (languages, package manager, key scripts, CI).
4. **Repository Tour** — High-level directory map with responsibilities and ownership hints.
5. **Tooling & Setup** — Required runtimes, package managers, environment variables, secrets.
6. **Common Tasks** — Lint/test/build/deploy commands. Prefer listing `just` recipes first, then `make` targets, then raw commands.
7. **Testing & Quality** — When and how to run tests, linting, formatting, coverage, and CI expectations.
8. **Workflow Expectations** — Branching model, review norms, feature flagging, deployment cadence.
9. **Documentation Duties** — When to update `README.md`, architecture diagrams, or other docs.
10. **Finish the Task** — Mandatory wrap-up checklist for every agent task.

For deeper directories (e.g., `services/api/`), include a "Scope" note at the top clarifying inheritance from parent AGENTS instructions. Always confirm with the developer before drafting new per-directory AGENTS files so you do not duplicate existing guidance or create unnecessary overhead.

## Phase 3 · Compose AGENTS.md
Use the template below and adapt each section to the project:

```markdown
# Project Agent Guide

> Scope: Root project (applies to all subdirectories unless overridden)

## Context Marker

The marker for this instruction is: 🧠

## Quick Facts
- **Primary language:**
- **Package manager:**
- **Entrypoints:**
- **CI/CD:**

## Repository Tour
- `path/` — description & owner

## Tooling & Setup
- Install instructions (per OS)
- Required environment variables (with purpose)
- Secrets management notes

## Common Tasks
- `just <task>` — what it does (preferred)
- `make <target>` — what it does
- Raw command fallback when automation missing

## Testing & Quality Gates
- Unit/integration test commands
- Lint/format commands
- Coverage expectations & thresholds
- CI status command or dashboard link

## Workflow Expectations
- Branch naming and review rules
- Feature toggles or release cadence
- Any approval or ticket linkage requirements

## Documentation Duties
- Update `README.md` when features, setup steps, or developer ergonomics change materially
- List other docs to refresh (architecture, ADRs, etc.)

## Finish the Task Checklist
- [ ] Update relevant docs (& `README.md` if significant changes landed)
- [ ] Summarize changes in conventional commit format (e.g., `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`)
```

### Subdirectory Template (Use Only with Developer Approval)
```markdown
# <Directory Name> Agent Guide

> Scope: ./path/to/directory (inherits root AGENTS.md unless noted)

## Purpose
- What lives here
- Who owns it (team/contact)

## Key Files
- `file_or_folder/` — why it matters

## Common Tasks
- `just <task>` / `make <target>` / command snippets scoped to this directory

## Testing & Quality
- Specific tests, linters, or data fixtures for this directory

## Hand-off Notes
- Docs or runbooks to reference
- Open questions captured during discovery
```
Only create these per-directory guides after confirming with the developer which areas need dedicated context and what information should be emphasized.

**Writing Notes:**
- The Context Marker section signals to agents (and users) that project-specific context is loaded. Agents following emoji marker conventions will prepend 🧠 to responses, confirming AGENTS.md was read.
- Keep language direct and actionable. Agents should follow commands verbatim.
- Mention the preferred order of operations (e.g., "Always run `just format` before opening a PR").
- When referencing scripts, include relative paths so agents can jump quickly (e.g., ``scripts/bootstrap.sh``).
- Incorporate a trimmed `tree --gitignore` snapshot (or link to the saved artifact) so readers grasp layout quickly.
- In the Repository Tour, highlight where `plans/`, `docs/`, design docs, or ADRs live if present.
- Call out any unanswered questions as action items, and confirm with the developer before creating any per-directory AGENTS overlays.
- If the project mixes languages/platforms, add subsections per component but keep global guidance first.

## Phase 4 · Validate & Wrap Up
1. **Self-review**
   - Does the file respect AGENTS scope rules? (Mention inheritance or overrides.)
   - Are all critical commands documented, especially automation entry points?
   - Is the README update expectation explicit?
   - Did you obtain developer approval before adding any per-directory AGENTS files, and is that approval reflected in the write-up?
   - Does the "Finish the Task" checklist include the conventional commit summary reminder?
2. **Formatting**
   - Ensure headings use Title Case, commands are wrapped in backticks, and lists are concise.
   - Keep sections under ~8 bullets unless a table is clearer.
3. **Handoff Summary**
   - When delivering the AGENTS.md to the user, include:
     - A short summary of major sections added/updated.
     - Confirmation that README and conventional commit reminders are present.
     - Any follow-up suggestions (e.g., missing tests or outdated scripts).
